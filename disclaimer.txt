Hi Hayleigh.

I Have looked at Darren's website and i think i could do a better job. I Have sent you a link to the website which i am hosting at the minute and would love to lnow if Darren would consider being my first customer for my Web Design Buisiness. Let me know if you like it, i can add more features but the point of a preview is a basic look at the site.
It would cost but i can offer a price of 2.50 Per month and that includes everything you would need.

Jack
